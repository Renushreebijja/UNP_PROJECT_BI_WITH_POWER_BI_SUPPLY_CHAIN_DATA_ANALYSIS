# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_ANALYSIS

I completed a Supply Chain Analysis project in collaboration with UNP using Power BI Desktop to evaluate end-to-end supply chain performance.
The dashboard tracks key KPIs including Total Revenue, Units Sold, Supply Chain Cost, Average Lead Time, and Defect Rate. It analyzes revenue versus cost across product categories such as Skincare, Haircare, and Cosmetics. The report identifies high-demand SKUs with availability risks and highlights revenue at risk due to low stock levels. Supplier performance is assessed based on lead time, manufacturing cost, and quality defect rates. Transportation modes (Air, Rail, Road, Sea) are compared to determine the best cost–time balance. The project delivers strategic insights for inventory optimization, supplier evaluation, cost control, and demand-driven planning. This project strengthened my skills in data visualization, KPI interpretation, and business decision-making using Power BI
